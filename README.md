How to use:
---

If you don't already have a Discord bot:

 - I won't teach you how to make a Discord bot. I'll assume you already have an existing Discord bot. If not, see this article: https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/how-to-make-a-discord-bot/

If you do have a Discord bot:

 - Add the file called rosterBot.js into your Discord bot's directory. Make sure you have your .env file with your Discord ID token.
 - You should have Node installed. If not, refer to "If you don't already have a Discord bot". Open a terminal (such as cmd.exe or Git Bash) and move your working directory to the directory in which this code is located.
 - Type into your terminal "node rosterBot.js" and execute the command (press enter).
 - You should see something like: "Logged in as DiscordBotName#0000!" where the DiscordBotName is your Discord bot's name and 0000 is your Discord bot's 4 digit Discord username code. 
 - If you do not see something like that, refer to the article in the "if you don't already have a Discord bot" section and find out what you did differently.
 - Myself, X3liteNinjaX#6891 on Discord, will probably be willing to help you!
